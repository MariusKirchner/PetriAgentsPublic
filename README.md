# PetriAgents
Combination of Agent-based modeling with Petri net simulations 

Final product will be an easy to use GUI interface for creation of Agent based simulations with multiple types of agents that each have their own behaviours and corresponding Petri nets. Finished simulation includes custom flow of molecules in the environment, inflow of these into the bacteria depending on the concentration and behaviour depending on the Petri nets of each agent. 

To write:
How to use this program.


Goal => do as much as possible in NL, as API can be slow, only Petri net calculation and interface in Python => in each tick there should be one API Call per agent, reducable to one call for all agents (faster that way).
